  Hello, my name is Riza Erdi Karakuş. I graduated from the Computer Engineering department at Maltepe University. After graduation, I worked on several projects using ASP.NET and later decided to learn Swift programming language. I have been working at a company for about a year, where I have been involved in many projects.

  Developing several projects has enhanced my analytical skills, allowing me to provide suitable solutions to both my team members and clients. Collaborating and working in a team to successfully complete projects brings me great satisfaction.
  
  My interest in technology motivates me to continue learning and developing myself. Therefore, I take time to research and implement new technologies.

  My goal is to continue growing both personally and professionally by investing in self-education. In the future, I see myself working on bigger and more challenging projects and being recognized as a technology leader.

  I hope this information is sufficient. If you would like to know more about me, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you.

          TodoList is an application that allows users to add their tasks in a sequence and create a shopping list. This project is developed in the swift programming language and uses sqlite for the backend. It is developed using the Viper design pattern. The biggest challenge in this project was using the Viper pattern correctly.
          
          With this project, users can add their tasks in a sequence and mark them as completed whenever they want. They can also create a shopping list and update it at any time. This application will help users to stay organized and keep track of their tasks.

          With our project called Donatbi, we have developed a food ordering application where users can order food to their address whenever they want. The application also allows users to order from restaurants and pick up their food at their desired time. Users can also make reservations at restaurants and pay for their meals online without wasting time.
